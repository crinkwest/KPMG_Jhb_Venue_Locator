# Venue Locator

This project was started to assist staff and visitors at the KPMG offices in
Johannesburg to easily locate Business Units and Boardrooms and quickly be
in a position to identify whether the venue chosen has the required resources
available, such as projector etc.

The code was started using the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com)
